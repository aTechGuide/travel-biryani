Here are few commonly asked questions about this recipe and I have tried my best to answer them for you

<br/>

**Question 1: How to make the namkeen crispy?**{: .heading2}  
Firstly adding oil to the dough, increases crispiness. Secondly double frying the namkeen also helps

<br/>
<br/>

**Question 2: Can this be given to children?**{: .heading2}  
Of course, children love it and its definitely a healthier option than store bought snack.

<br/>
<br/>

**Question 3: Other than all purpose flour what else can be added?**{: .heading2}  
Rice flour can be used, gram flour can be used, semolina can be used, but they all taste different, and the ones made with Atta do not turn out very crispy.

<br/>
<br/>

**Question 4: Is this healthy?**{: .heading2}  
It is relatively healthy, however it can be baked too, instead of deep frying, at a temperature of 200 for 10-15 minutes.

<br/>
<br/>

**Question 5: How long can this be stored?**{: .heading2}  
It can be stored in air tight containers for 30 to 45 days.

<br/>
<br/>

So there we are, an absolute delight is ready.  
You guys will love it, I am sure about that.
