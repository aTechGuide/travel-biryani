**Time**{: .firstword} is an uber precious commodity and with the hustle and bustle of modern day living its getting even more difficult for us to manage a quick dinner after work or entertain sudden dinner guests at home.  
Well, we all have faced this at some point in time that we had very little time to brew up a delicious potful of chicken curry. This chicken curry recipe is meant exactly for those times.

<br/>

This spicy recipe of chicken became a favourite for my sister who every now and then insisted that I make this for her and due to its very simplicity I would happily oblige.

<br/>

This recipe takes very little time approximately 20 mins from prep to plate and has the potency to please both the palate and the body. The ingredients are the very basic required for any Indian curry and is definitely not that flamboyant as most chicken curries seem to be.

<br/>

So lets get started

- The chicken pieces should be 1x1  inch to decrease the cooking time
- It is always advisable to use homemade spices to bring out flavors better
- Spices should be roasted to increase their flavors
