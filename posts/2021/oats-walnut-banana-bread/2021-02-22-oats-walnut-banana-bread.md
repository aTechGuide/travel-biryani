You need a Healthy cake to bake over the weekend, well something that pleasures your palate but spares you the guilt of cheating on your diet, well the Oats Walnut Banana Bread is your answer to all that.

<br/>

The origins of this can be traced to Britain where the culture of high tea and afternoon tea among the aristocrats necessitated the chefs to formulate new and beautiful recipes, recipes that we enjoy till date.

<br/>

This is a Diabetic friendly and a Diet friendly recipe and can be easily made within 30 to 40 minutes.

<br/>

Even though it is essentially a Banana cake however it is rather called a Banana bread since it is comparatively denser than a cake.

<br/>

Add walnuts to it and it becomes a BananaWalnut cake, other nuts like pecans, brazil nuts and raisins can also be added and all these variations are amazingly fresh and tasty.

<br/>

It is an Eggless cake, hence it is both vegetarian and vegan friendly and is inclusive in all ways.

<br/>

When you have overripe bananas ,this is an amazing way of using ripe bananas and the softer and sweeter the bananas the better the recipe turns out to be, it works with the natural sweetness of bananas.

<br/>

It is a delightfully quick to make cake and if you are new to making desserts, you can go ahead and try this as it is a very easy cake for beginners.

<br/>

The use of oat flour, replacing the usual all purpose flour makes this a beautifully healthy recipe, using almond flour is also an option, however I have found with my experiments that it makes the cake very very heavy and denser.

<br/>

Be sure to make this over the next weekend when you wake up the inner chef in you.
